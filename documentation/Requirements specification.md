# Requirements specification

## Purpose of the application

The purpose of the application is to allow the user to get an easily understandable and navigable overview of their runs. Today, there are a lot of different mobile apps and wearable 
technology that gathers data for the user about their activities. However, these often require an account, and perhaps even a subscription, and don't necessarily allow for local storage
of the data they gather - either because of the limited storage often found in smaller devices, or because of the design of the service. Also, simply because of the form factor of these 
platforms, they don’t always offer an easily understandable and navigable overview of the data they gather. A desktop application on the other hand, offers a larger platform 
providing an opportunity to browse and track your runs from the comfort of your home, after your run and locally store the data you collected on it.

## Users

The application is primarily aimed at single users, for whom the app offers a way to save, track, and browse the data they gather about their running.

## User interface

## Functinality

The user will be able to:
-	Create categories of runs (e.g. “Pavement”, “Trail”, “Track”, “5K”, “10K”, “tempo”. “easy” etc.),
-	Create subcategories to higher categories, e.g. “Surface” = {“Pavement”, “Trail”, “Track”}, “Distance” = {“5K”, “10K”},
-	Save runs by manually inputting data about them, including:
    - Duration,
    - Moment in time (e.g. date),
    - Distance,
    - .gpx file,
    - Avg. cadence,
    - Avg. speed,
    - Applicable user-created categories.
-	Edit data in saved runs.
-   Delete runs.
-	Browse runs by:
    - User-created categories.
    - (Time ?).
    - (Location ?).
-   See an overview of any run saved in the application and the data added to that run,
-	See an overview of all runs that match selected user-created categories including: 
    - graph of duration/avg. speed per moments in time
    - personal best (i.e. fastest run/shortest duration),
    - map of included routes (provided user has added .gpx files),
    - (graph of distance per moment in time, e.g. 7-day avg. ?)
    - (avg. cadence per moment in time ?)
