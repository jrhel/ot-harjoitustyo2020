| 10.11 | 3         | Continuation of the requirements specification and planning of the application. Researching and testing ways to implement a "slippy map" feature in the application.
| 11.11 | 3         | Planning of the required database and structure of the code. 
| 12.11 | 4         | Createing a Maven-project. Creating the package and basic object-structure of the code. Coding a basic text-UI for testing, and the DAO:s, including methods for storing data in the database, initiating the tables in the database, and resetting those tables. Addings upport for H2-database engine.
| 14.11 | 4         | Refining the previously written code, reserching ways for the code to handle time (i.e. durations and moments). Adding support for jacoco:report and Joda-Time in the project. Trying to get the dao.create(); methods to return the primary key for the executed update (i.e. added database ebtry).
| 15.11 | 4         | Testing implemented database methods, and refining the previously written code. First tests written for the DAO's and the application logic. Updating the README-file in the github repository.
| 17.11 | 2         | Refining and testeing the previously written code, writing a couple more tests, and making sure user can add categories and subcategories.
| 19.11 | 2         | Reviewed the database's ability to handle subcategories, and allow for attributes to be added to categories.
| 20.11 | 3         | Editing the previously written code and database to bettter handle subcategories, and added the ability for categories to have attributes.
| 22.11 | 3         | Coding ability for user to add runs, and testing this feature.
| 24.11 | 3         | Writing a couple of new tests for the DAO's and domain logic. Removing UI-package from the jacoco test coverage report. Adding support for Checkstyle. Updating .gitignore-file. Adding architecture description to project. Updating the README-file in the github repository.
| 25.11 | 2         | Making general design of the "start page", ability to add runs, ability to add categories, and the "view" of a selected run and the data related to it. 
| 28.11 | 3         | Expanding database and application logic to support relationships bewteen rusn and user generated categories
| 29.11 | 3         | Beginning coding GUI and coding ability to see all runs added in the application, adding ability for create() methods of DAO-objects to return created database entry's primary key, and refining previously written code.
| 30.11 | 1         | Adding ability to delete runs.         
| 1.12  | 3         | Adding support for jar, and creating executable jar file of project. Updating project documentation in project remote repository. Excluded GUI from checkstyle, and fixed checkstyle error elsewhere in the code. Adding a few Tests. Expanding GUI a bit. Adding a preliminary release with respect to this weeks original deadline.
| 2.12  | 5         | Expanding GUI to allow user to add new categories. Refined and tested previously written code. Creating a few more tests. Adding final release for week 5 to remote repository, and updating project documentation.
| 3.12  | 1         | Added draft UI to remote repository.
| 7.12  | 4         | Refining previously written code and tests, trying to decouple database operations generated by tests from database operations generated by user input, so that the user's database wouldn't change every time tests were run while also retaining all functionality of previously written tests.
| 8.12  | 1         | Finally managed to decouple database operations generated by tests from database operations generated by user input while retaining all test functionality.
| Tot.  | 56        |
